# Orbit AI Simulation - Environment Configuration
#
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your API keys
# NEVER commit your .env file with real API keys!

# OpenAI API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# ElevenLabs API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here

# Note: You can also configure API keys directly in Unity's ScriptableObject assets
# Located at: Assets/Resources/OpenAISettings.asset and Assets/Resources/Agents/ElevenLabsSettings.asset
# But using environment variables is more secure for development!
