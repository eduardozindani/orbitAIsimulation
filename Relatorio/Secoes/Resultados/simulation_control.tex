\subsection{Time Manipulation}
\label{subsec:time_control}

[STUB: Demonstrates playback control, disambiguation between orbital velocity and simulation speed]

\subsubsection{User Interaction}

[STUB: Voice transcript: "Speed up the simulation"]

[STUB: Figure - UI showing "10x" speed multiplier indicator in spatial world space]

\subsubsection{System Execution}

[STUB: Agent selects set\_simulation\_speed tool (not orbit modification)]

[STUB: Distinguishes: orbital velocity (physics constant) vs time multiplier (playback variable)]

[STUB: Sets speed\_multiplier = 10x within constraint range 0.1-100x]

[STUB: VR visualization shows satellite moving 10x faster around orbit]

\subsubsection{Educational Value}

[STUB: Prevents common misconception - "speed" does not change orbital velocity]

[STUB: Demonstrates tool disambiguation from 460-line prompt guidance]

\subsubsection{Capabilities Demonstrated}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tool selection accuracy (set\_simulation\_speed vs create\_orbit tools)
    \item Real-time simulation parameter control (Objective \#4)
    \item Spatial UI rendering in VR (Appendix~\ref{app:vr_implementation})
    \item Misconception prevention through prompt engineering
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Workspace Management}
\label{subsec:workspace_management}

[STUB: Demonstrates iterative exploration workflow, orbit clearing, rebuilding]

\subsubsection{User Interaction}

[STUB: Voice transcript sequence: "Clear the current orbit" → "Now create an orbit at 1000 km altitude"]

[STUB: Figure - Before/after screenshots showing orbit removal and new orbit creation]

\subsubsection{System Execution}

[STUB: Agent executes clear\_orbit tool]

[STUB: OrbitController removes trajectory visualization]

[STUB: Follow-up orbit creation in clean workspace]

\subsubsection{Educational Value}

[STUB: Supports iterative learning - hypothesis testing, comparison, refinement]

[STUB: Enables exploration without accumulating visual clutter]

\subsubsection{Capabilities Demonstrated}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete tool suite integration (8 tools from Appendix~\ref{app:agent_implementation})
    \item Iterative exploration pattern supporting embodied learning
    \item Workspace state management
\end{itemize}
