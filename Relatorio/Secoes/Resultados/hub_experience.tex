\subsection{Overview}

The Hub environment serves as the user's first point of contact with the platform, introducing the conversational interface and VR spatial context. This section demonstrates the initial user experience: entering the virtual environment, meeting the Mission Control agent, and understanding the interaction paradigm.

\subsection{Environment Entry}
