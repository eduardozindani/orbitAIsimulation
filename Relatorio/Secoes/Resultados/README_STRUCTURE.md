## Section Purposes

### 4.1 Hub Experience
**Purpose:** First contact, VR immersion, Mission Control introduction
**Key Demo:** User enters environment, greets agent, sees spatial context
**Proves:** VR works, voice works, character established

### 4.2 Creating Orbital Trajectories
**Purpose:** Core functionality - natural language → physics → visualization
**Key Demos:**
- ISS circular orbit (420 km → 7.66 km/s)
- Elliptical orbit (eccentricity visualization)
- Comparing ISS vs Hubble orbits

**Proves:** Objectives #1, #2, #3, #4 all working together

### 4.3 Mission Space Exploration
**Purpose:** Scene transitions, character switching, specialist knowledge
**Key Demos:**
- Routing to ISS (scene transition, Anastasia introduction)
- Educational dialogue ("Why 51.6° inclination?")
- Voyager escape (Karl's philosophical voice, hyperbolic trajectory)

**Proves:** Objective #5 (modular architecture), dual-character system, context persistence

### 4.4 Simulation Control
**Purpose:** User control, tool disambiguation, iterative exploration
**Key Demos:**
- Time speed manipulation (10x multiplier)
- Workspace clearing and rebuilding

**Proves:** Complete tool suite working, misconception prevention

### 4.5 Open-Source Delivery
**Purpose:** Objective #6 fulfillment
**Content:**
- GitHub repository confirmation
- User API key setup
- Documentation structure
- Extensibility examples

**Proves:** Community accessibility, modular extensibility

### 4.6 Complete System Demonstration
**Purpose:** Full end-to-end workflow validation
**Content:**
- YouTube video link showing uninterrupted demo
- Coverage of all scenarios in sequence
- Proves real-time integration of all 4 modules
- Demonstrates educational effectiveness

**Proves:** Complete system working as promised, Objective #4 (real-time coherence)

## Iteration Strategy

Work through sections sequentially:
1. Start with 4.1 (simplest - just environment and greeting)
2. Move to 4.2.1 (ISS orbit - most important demo)
3. Build out remaining scenarios
4. Add figures/screenshots as we fill content
5. Performance and open-source sections last (factual, brief)

## Key Principles

- **Each section = complete user journey** (not isolated features)
- **Visual focus** - every scenario needs screenshot/figure
- **Reference back** - connect to objectives, methodology, appendices
- **Voice transcripts** - show actual agent responses
- **Integration proof** - show all 4 modules working together

## Stubs to Fill

Each stub marked with `[STUB: ...]` indicates:
- Description needed
- Figure/screenshot needed
- Voice transcript example needed
- Technical detail needed

Iterate section-by-section, filling stubs with demo content.
