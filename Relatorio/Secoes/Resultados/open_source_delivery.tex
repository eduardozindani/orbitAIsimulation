The complete platform source code, including Unity C\# scripts, conversational agent prompts, configuration assets, and Quest 3 deployment settings, is publicly available on GitHub, fulfilling Objective \#6 from Section~\ref{sec:objetivos}. The repository provides comprehensive documentation covering system architecture, Unity configuration procedures, and Quest 3 build instructions, enabling community validation, adaptation, and extension.

\subsection{Repository Structure}

[STUB: GitHub repository organization - Assets/, Relatorio/, documentation]

[STUB: Key files documented: PromptSettings.asset, OrbitController.cs, ElevenLabsClient.cs, etc.]

\subsection{User API Key Configuration}

Users provide their own OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys through Unity Inspector configuration, ensuring platform accessibility without imposed service costs. The documentation guides users through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Obtaining OpenAI API key for GPT-4.1 access
    \item Configuring ElevenLabs API key for voice synthesis/transcription
    \item Setting voice IDs for character customization
    \item Adjusting prompt templates for educational customization
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quest 3 Deployment Documentation}

[STUB: Build configuration instructions - Android SDK, Unity XR packages, Oculus integration]

[STUB: Step-by-step deployment guide from Unity to Quest 3 device]

\subsection{Extensibility Demonstrations}

The modular architecture (Objective \#5) enables straightforward extensions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding new mission specialists by creating MissionConfig ScriptableObject assets
    \item Extending tool suite with new orbit types or celestial bodies
    \item Customizing educational prompts for different learning contexts
    \item Adapting voice characters for different languages or audiences
\end{itemize}

[STUB: Example - Adding Mars mission would require Mars\_Config.asset + Mars.unity scene]

This open-source delivery validates the platform's educational accessibility and community extensibility objectives established in the thesis motivation (Section~\ref{sec:motivation}).
