\subsection*{General Objective}

To develop an interactive, agent-guided simulation platform that enables users to explore and understand orbital mechanics through embodied interaction, combining natural language dialogue and real-time virtual reality visualizations.

\subsection*{Specific Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Design and implement a simulation environment capable of rendering orbital trajectories in real time, grounded in physics-consistent models implementing Keplerian two-body dynamics.
\item Integrate a generative agent capable of interpreting natural language input, translating it into simulation parameters, and guiding the user through explanations and interactions.
\item Enable multimodal interaction by combining voice commands, spatial presence, and mixed reality visual feedback (VR immersion and AR passthrough capabilities) to create a seamless and intuitive user experience optimized for learning orbital mechanics concepts.
\item Ensure that all components of the system, simulation and agent, function coherently and communicate reliably in real time.
\item Create a system architecture that is modular and extensible, allowing for future expansion to other celestial bodies, educational modules, or mission types.
\item Validate system functionality through complete interaction scenarios and provide reproducible implementation documentation, enabling independent verification of technical feasibility claims.
\end{enumerate}
