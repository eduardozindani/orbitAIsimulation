\subsection*{General Objective}

To develop an interactive, agent-guided simulation platform that enables users to explore and understand orbital mechanics through embodied interaction, combining natural language dialogue and real-time augmented reality visualizations.

\subsection*{Specific Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Design and implement a simulation environment capable of rendering orbital trajectories in real time, grounded in physically accurate models.
\item Integrate a generative agent capable of interpreting natural language input, translating it into simulation parameters, and guiding the user through explanations and interactions.
\item Enable multimodal interaction by combining voice commands, spatial movement, and augmented reality visual feedback to create a seamless and intuitive user experience.
\item Ensure that all components of the system, simulation and agent, function coherently and communicate reliably in real time.
\item Create a system architecture that is modular and extensible, allowing for future expansion to other celestial bodies, educational modules, or mission types.
\item Evaluate the platform's potential as an educational tool for facilitating conceptual understanding of orbital mechanics through exploratory learning.
\end{enumerate}
